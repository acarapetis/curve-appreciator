# curve-appreciator (working title)

> This project is a work in progress.
> 
> This project tries to create something analogous to a metronome, for the eye.
> 
> (A metronome helps keep time for a piece of music/helps develop a sense of
> timing. Similarly, this visualization can be used to develop/improve a sense
> of the visual "speed" in a composition—especially one with long linear
> elements.)
> 
> Robert Henri (1865-1929) was an American painter and instructor, who taught
> at the school where I first learned to draw and paint, under instructor Dan
> Thompson—The Art Students League of New York.
> 
> Refer to the recorded fragments of Henri's teachings and notes.  
> Talking of the brush stroke, Henri stated that there are—
> 
> "Strokes which carry the observer with exact degrees of speed.  
>  Strokes which increase their speed, or decrease it."
> 
> Drawing from life, in line—especially figure drawing, helped me develop a
> (fairly clear) sense of the visual "speed" of a drawn or painted line.
> 
> I wish to make intuitive ideas shared by many painters and draftsmen, clearer
> and more accessible.
> 
> I hope this project makes some of the ideas Henri mentioned and my own sense
> of navigating visuals more comprehensible to you.
> 
> I value deliberate drawing, good craftsmanship, and clear use of terminology
> and ideas in the visual arts.

> 
> This project would not have been possible without the mathematics and code by
> Anthony.
